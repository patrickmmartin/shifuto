Outline: Evolution of Type Safety in Programming Pipelines and the Impact of LLMs
Introduction (2 minutes)
Brief overview of programming pipelines and their evolution
Thesis: Development of stronger type systems and static analysis tools has moved verification earlier in the build pipeline, and LLMs will accelerate this trend
Importance of catching issues early: the "shift left" philosophy
Historical Context: 1990s to Early 2000s (3 minutes)
Limited type systems in mainstream languages (C, early Java)
Runtime errors vs compile-time errors
Focus on testing as primary verification strategy
Examples of early static analysis tools and their limitations
The Type Renaissance: Mid-2000s to 2010s (4 minutes)
Rise of languages with advanced type systems
Scala, Haskell, F#, TypeScript
Introduction of generics in mainstream languages
Gradual shift from dynamic to static typing
Case study: JavaScript to TypeScript transition
Modern Build Pipelines: 2010s to Present (4 minutes)
Integration of static analysis into CI/CD
Linting, type checking, and property-based testing
Smart IDEs and real-time feedback
Example: Rust's ownership system and borrow checker
Case study: How Facebook's Flow/TypeScript adoption reduced runtime errors
Enter LLMs: The New Paradigm (5 minutes)
How LLMs understand and generate typed code
Code completion vs code generation
LLMs as "type-aware" assistants
Shift from verification to suggestion and generation
Examples of LLMs handling complex type constraints
The Future Landscape (2 minutes)
Prediction: More declarative programming
Types as specifications that LLMs implement
Increased focus on formal verification
Potential for "prove then code" methodologies
Hybrid systems: human design, LLM implementation, compiler verification
Conclusion and Q&A Preparation (1 minute)
Recap of the evolution toward earlier verification
The circular pattern: from simple typing to runtime checks to advanced typing to AI assistance
