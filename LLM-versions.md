## The Prompt

```text
Please create the outline of a 20 minute technical presentation on the topic of how common programming pipelines in a range of languages allow for the definition of concepts and invariants early in the build pipeline. The focus should be on how this has evolved in the last 30 years or so, and how the ability to use LLMs to reliably generate code will impact past practices
